# ProjectWatchTower

Posible addition: 
  Add a feature to have the user create a sort of "todo" list in which they've set themselves some tasks to do within a certain time, if they complete the task the can tick it off, which updates the total, otherwise if they don't complete it by the date specified, then it's cleared from the list and a negative entry is added to the total. 
   Also, if they don't enter a certain number of items per day (say, 5) then a negative entry is added for each item not present.
